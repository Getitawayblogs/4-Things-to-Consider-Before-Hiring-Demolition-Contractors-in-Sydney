                <section>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;"> <img style="height: 650px; width: 60%" src="https://www.getitaway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/things-to-consider.jpg"></div>
                    <p>There is an abundance of demolition contractors in Sydney, leaving you to wonder – who is the best to hire for your project? Getting the right team of professionals for the job can ensure that the job is done safely and correctly.</p>
                    <p>As it is a growing industry, there are many companies to choose from, making it hard to make the final decision. That’s why it is crucial to consider all factors before determining which demolition contractors in Sydney to pick.</p>
                    <p>To help you out, we’ve listed four things you should consider before <a href="https://www.getitaway.com.au/detailed-demolition/">hiring demolition contractors</a> in Sydney for your project.</p>
                    <h2>1. Surf The Internet</h2>
                    <p>Doing your research online should be at the top of your list before hiring the right demolition contractors in Sydney. There are countless online forums out there that provide detailed reviews from previous customers. Providing their own experience working with the company gives insight into what it would be like if you hired their staff for a project.</p>
                    <p>While reading reviews is incredibly useful, they should be taken with a grain of salt. These reviews can be misleading as they could be written by people who are connected to the company. This can leave you with a skewed and biased view of how these demolition contractors in Sydney will do the job.</p>
                    <h2>2. Years Of Experience</h2>
                    <p>Another factor considers when choosing demolition contractors in Sydney to work on a project is how long have, they been in existence. If a company has been running for years, its tradespeople have years of experience in their back belts to know how to do the job correctly.</p>
                    <p>New companies require a few more years in the playing field before becoming a household name in the industry. In some cases, businesses that are just starting could potentially be former companies looking to clear their poor reputation.</p>

                    <h2>3. Insurance & Qualifications</h2>
                    <p>The number one question to ask before hiring is whether their demolition contractors in Sydney are fully licensed. It is necessary to check if they have Safe Work insurance to perform asbestos removal and demolish structures. Another license they should have is their Public Liability and Worker’s Compensation insurance.</p>
                    <p>They should provide you with documentation of their license and insurance policy. If the company can’t be upfront with these files, this is a sign they may not have the documentation to prove their demolition contractors in Sydney have full insurance.</p>
                    <h2>4. Quote & Project Timeframe</h2>
                    <p>Last but not least, it is crucial to consider the logistics before making your final decision. The best demolition contractors in Sydney will provide you with a comprehensive quote. This details what their duties are and the overall cost of their services. They should be transparent and do everything that is required during the project.</p>
                    <p>It’s highly important to get a clear and transparent time frame of how long the project will take to finalize. Typically for a standard house, it would take a week to complete. For more large-scale projects, it may take 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
                    <p>In these cases, you may need to consider your holding costs and the risk of getting building fines. Some demolition contractors in Sydney may overdo it before signing you on board, only for them to take a while to get the job finalised. This can end up costing you more than what you bargained for.</p>
                    <p>The price of their services is also significant to look over in your quote. While the cost might be incredibly affordable, you might find yourself having a lot of issues with the demolition contractors in Sydney.</p>
